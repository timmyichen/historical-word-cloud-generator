The\ndate of the cipher was October 12, and\nthe location of the Cormoran was not\ndisclosed.\n\"Permission was not granted to send\nthe cablegram and the officers and men\nwere interned.\n\"December 14, 1914, the German\nauxiliary' cruiser Cormoran appeared\noff the harbor of Apia, and sent a\nradio, asking permission to enter for\ncoal and provisions. She was allowed\nto e.nter and the commanding officer\nto visit the governor. Commanding\nOfficer Juckschwerdt stated that he had\njust come from the South seas and was\nshort of coal, had only about fifty tons\non board and requested 1,500 tons of\ncoal and provisions, to reach his nearest\nhome port in German East Africa.\nThe governor repiie.d that he could\nfurnish only 200 tons of coal and thirty\ndays' provisions only could be spared,\nand the commanding officer was given\nthe alternative of departing within\ntwenty-four hours or being interned.\n\"December 15. 1914, at 10 a.m.. the\ncommanding officer decided to remain\nin port, and the ship and its personnel\nwere interned.\nFormerly in Russian Fleet.\n\"The Cormoran was formerly a\nsteamer in the Russian volunteer fleet,\nwas captured early in the morning of\nAugust 3 by S.

She was\na new speedy ship, built at the German\nworks of Schichau. She was taken to\nTsingtao and was overhauled and\ncould do better than seventeen knots.\nShe was equipped with guns, manned\nby a German crew. The old German\ngunboat Cormorant was being dismantled\nat Tsingtao and the captain and\n; most of her crew were transferred to\nthe newly converted auxiliary cruiser.\nShe was taken the first night of the\nwar and was the first prize of the\nEmden.

Senator\nChamberlain said, to the desire to expedite\npassage of the measure supplying\nthe regular military establishment's\nneeds, beginning July 1. Also\nthe original Chamberlain bill, which\nwas reported as a \"rider\" to the appropriation\nmeasure last month, has\nbeen materially amended.\nAt Tuesday's committee meeting it\nis planned to have Secretary Baker,\nMaJ.

Chairman Dent\nstated no detail^ could be given out because\nthe Secretary had not gone over\nthem yet, and only discussed the provisions\nof the general staff bill in a\ngeneral way. Mr. Dent made the important\nannouncement that it was the\nbelief that the first lighting unit of\n600,000 men should be raised by draft,\nas the voluntary system was not workable.\nThe filling up of the existing army and\nmilitia should be done by voluntary enlistment.\nThe War Department asked the committee\nto add a provision to the bill authorizing\nthe President to maintain by\nvoluntary enlistment or draft special and\ntechnical troops and embody them in an\norga.niza.iiun, io uu omcertru as proviueu\nby existing law.\nIn the War Department further\nmoves toward mustering a great army\nawait action by Congress. Every preliminary\nstep already has been taken,\nhowever, to carry out the project of\nraising and training a million men in\na year and supplying them with full\nwar equipment. The only thing that\ncan be done Vat the War Department\nwithout congressional action is to order\nthe regular army expanded to full\nwar strength.\nPlans have been laid for calling the\nfull strength of the general staff to\nWashington to help in administration\nof the huge task of army building before\nthe department. Only half of the\nauthorized strength of the staff can\nnow be of duty here under existing\nlaw.

Most of the money\nderived from such bonds, it is expected,\nwould be spent in the United States.\nDetails of that sort of a bond issue\nhave not been worked out, but it is expected\nlegislation to provide for it will\nbe presented to Congress soon.\nDivision of the Burden.\nOn the question of taxation Congress\n| leaders feel that the burden of the war\n! should be about equally divided between\nj taxation and bond issues.

Instantly plans of the\ni navy for just such a situation became\n; i operative and while they were not dis.\nclosed there, was assurance that if the\naudacious warship held her course she\n! would be given a warm reception.\n; ' Meantime shipping in the vtcimcy was\ni warned to make port or hold its anchorage.\nThe weather was thick off the\ncoast, and it was not expected that the\nstranger would be sighted again until\nshe was at close quarters with some\n.vessel of the coast patrol fleet.\nIt was at 7:40 o'clock that the war[\npainted craft loomed out of the fog\nsome fifty miles south of Nantucket Island\nand about eighty-five miles east of\nNewport. She was directly in the lane\n, for westbound shipping, and not more\nthan 200 miles by the usual course from\nNew York.\nVessel of 10.000 Tons.\nThe supposed raider showed two masts\nand a huge smokestack. She appeared\nto be of about 10,000 tons, and some\nshipping men who heard this description\nexpressed the opinion that she was\nan armored cruiser disguised as a merchantman.\nA few minutes after she\nwas picked up the vessel was lost again\nin the fog.\nNantucket lightship, the outpost for\nj westbound shipping, is anchored fortyi\nfive miles east by south of Nantucket\nIsland and ninety miles east of New;\nport. It is 192. miles east of Ambrose\nj channel lightship, at the entrance to\nNew York harbor, and marks the turni\n< ing point for westbound craft heading\nin for Newport and New York,\ni The raider was holding the regulation\ncourse and would have been with\nin easy striking distance of outward\n1 bound shipping. However, so far as\nknown, no vessels were moving out\n? past the shoals at the time the hostile\n, ship was sighted.\nI BOSTON. April 7.?A radio message\n; | received at the Boston navy yard said\n! ! the raider lay about three miles off the\n| lightship for half an hour, and then pro\n< eeded westward, where she was lost to\n, j view.\nAlarm From Virginia Capes.\nj NEWPORT NEWS, Va., April 7.?The\n1 i presence of a German raider off the\nVirginia capes was officially reported\nhere today.
