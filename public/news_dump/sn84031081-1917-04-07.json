Measures to\nmake ready for actual hostilities with\nGermany went forward swiftly today\nat the war and navy departments, and\nPresident Wilson issued a statement\nurging the prompt enactment of the\ngeneral staff's army plans, to be taken\nup tomorrow by the house military\ncommittee.\nComplete mobilization of the navy\nwas ordered by Secretary Daniels im\nmediately after the cabinet meeting.\nThe naval militia and naval reserve,\ntotalling nearly 15,000 men, will join\nthe colors within two or three days.\nEvery preliminary arrangement had\nbeen made.\nMobilization means the immediate\norganization f (No coast patrol serv\nice, V , M'p.r of the swift,\nprivately-owned motor craft already\nenrolled.

Every\npreliminary step already has been\ntaken, however, to carry out the proj\nect of raising and training a million\nmen In a year and supplying them\nwith full war equipment.\nNews that the war status had been\nproclaimed hy President Wilson was\nflashed to army and navy posts and\nships throughout the world as soon as\nthe war resolution was signed at the\nWhite House. The only other thing\nthat can be done at the war depart\nment without congressional action 1r\nto order the regular army expanded\nto full war strength.\nSupport General Staff Plim.\nTn his statement. President Wilson\nformally set himself on record as sup\nporting the general staff plans for the\narmy in every detail, including the\nprovision for selective draft to obtain\nmen. Later in the day. Chairman\nDent of the house military committee-called\nto see Secretary Paker. who\nwill take the staff plan and its ac\ncompanying $.1,000,000,000 budget be\nfore the committee tomorrow.\nThe conference had to do with the\ndraft clause of the bill, to which con\nsiderable opposition is expected at the\ncapltol.\nMr. Dent said afterward that lie\ncould not forecast the sentiment of\ncongress, but that he personally was\nprepared to surrender his own objec\ntions to compulsory service and do all\nin his power to secure harmony of\naction between congress and the ad\nministration. The creation of sixteen training\ncenters would provide for two in\nfantry divisions at each post. Pre\nsumably the centers for the four cav\nalry divisions would be somewhere In\nthe region pf the Mexican border so\nthat this mounted force can take over\nthe border patrol work to a large ex\ntent, relieving the majority of the\npresent regiments now assembled\nthere.\nCan Absorb Half Million.\nWith the calling out of the first\n500,000 of the new army provision\nwould be made for a new complete\ndivision at each training center, the\nforces already there\" supplying the\nInstructors and all other machinery of\norganizations so that the half million\nyoung men could be absorbed with\nlittle disorder or delay.\nNo further steps toward calling out\nthe national guard Will be taken until\ncongress has acted. It is proposed to\ndraft the entire guard Into the federal\nservice, divorcing it from its militia\nstatus at once, instead of summoning\nthem tinder their dual allegiance or\nganization. This can be done only\nwith authority of congress. When\nthat has been granted, even the 60.\n000 guardsmen now in the federal\nservice on police duty will be drafted\nformally so as to do away with anyi\npossibility of dual authority over them\nor restriction on their use. i\nTISH DRIVE\nCONTINUES WITH\nSPLENDID GAINS\nNEAR PQNSSOY\nGermans Lose Heavily and\nMany Dead Are Found on\nBattlefield by Sir Douglas\nHaig's Forces,\nFRENCH ARMY ALSO\nREPORTS SUCCESSES\nRussians Suffer Severe Re\nverse; English and Slavs\nJoin Hands in Mesopo\ntamia; Turks Are Fleeing,\nGERMAN SHIPS IN\nAMERICAN PORTS\nARE SEIZED BY\nUNITED STATES\nWorking at Full Capacity, Un\ncle Sam Couldn't Duplicate\nTonnage in Year; One Ves\nsel Required Years,\nLIKELY MERCHANTMEN\nWILL BE PROMPTLY USED\nDamage Done by Crews Not\nDifficult to Repair; Wash\nington Policy Is to Be An\nnounced Soon,\nBryan Asks to\nEnrolled in Any\nService Needed\nIIV MORNINfl JOURNAL SPECIAL LIASKO WlftKj\nTallahassee, Fla., April B.
