This official's\nbelief was that the number ranged\nbetween 150,000 and 200,000.

Rather Than Spending.\nYour Social Standard.\n\"For partial immediate relief, every\nindividual and community should consider\nearnestly the matter of food\nconservation and the limitation of\nwaste. As n nation we seem to have\ni disdain of economizing. In many.'\nhemes there is a strong feeling that\nit is 'only decent' to provide more\nfood than will be eaten and that it\nis demeaning to reckon closely. The\nexperts of ihe Department of Agriculture\nreport to me that the dietary\nstudies made by them point to an\nannual food waste of about $700000,000.\nOf course, the waste in\nfamilies of very limited means is\nslight, but in the families of moderate\nand ample means the waste is\nconsiderable. Even if the estimate\nwere reduced bv half, the waste would\nstill lie enormous.\n\"The food waste in the household,\nthe experts assert, results in large\nmeasure from ' had preparation and\nhad cooking, from improper care and\nhandling, and, in well-to-do families,\nfrom serving an undue number of\ncourses and an over-abundant supply\nand failing to save and utilize the\nfood not consumed. As an instance of\nimproper handling, it is discovered\nthat in the preparation of potatoes\n20 per cent of the edible portion in\nmay cases is discarded.\" Secretary\nof Agriculture, March 3, 1017.\nFood is wasted when we eat more j\nfood than our bodies need for growth J\nand repair and to supply energy for\nour work. Overeating tends to poor\nhealth and fat instead of brawn,\nmakes us sluggish and indolent instead\nof energetic and resourceful.'\nEat enough and no more.
