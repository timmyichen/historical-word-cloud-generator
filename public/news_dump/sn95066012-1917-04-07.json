Tho suffrage bill has now been sign\ned by the Governor and reads thus:\n\"A female citizen 21 years of age\nwhose list Is taken in a town at the\nannual assessment preceding a town\nmeeting, and where tax or taxes due\nsuch town were paid prior to the 15th.\nday of February ' preceding a town\nmeeting', shall whjle residing lh such\ntown be a voter lh town meeting.\"\nThe \"town\" referred to includes\nvillage and city nieetlngs.

We would suggest\nthat they not enter such articles as\nwatches or pianos unless they possess\nmore than one, but enter money on\nhand not in the bank, the amount\nranging from one to five dollars and\nup. ,\nThe fame may bo listed under para\ngraph po section C. or furniture in\nexcess of 1500.00, may be listed under\nparagraph 16 section C. of the blank\nInventory.\nThe amount of tax upon these items\nwould not prove burdensome from\ntwenty-five cents up. according to the\namocnt listed arid the rate of tax.\nFailure to fill out such inventory\nand return same within the specified\ntime (before April 20th.) would de\nbar 9 woman from voting until March\nlyiS.rthis is why we urge immediate\naction.\nUnder the school lajv women ' now\nhave 'game rights as men.\" Men are\nobliged to take the freemans oath,\nwhile tbis Is not required of women to\nvote lit town meeting, it Is required of\nthem to vote in school meetings.\nTo avoid any confusion or possible\nquestion, we would suggest that all\nwomen go before the board of civil\nauthority and take the freemans oath,\nwhich Is a simple process, and at this\ncritical period of the nation's history,\nwould seem to be an act of patriot\nism. Women can take this oath of\nallegiance singly or in groups.\nIt is earnestly hoped that the wo\nmen of the state will now avail them\nselves of this long waited for opior\ntunity. and qualify at once, they will\nthen be ready to vote at the next\nMarch meeting upon ail community in\nterests such as public improvements,\nsanitary regulations, appropriation of\nmoney, election bf town and munici\npal officers, questions of bonding,\nschools, etCi 1 ' '\nWe desire to reach the women of\nyour town and every town In the state\nat once and we strongly urge you to\ncall as many other'orkers to your as\nsistance as possible.
