In a ?ratc\nfhent approving the army plan pre\nsents, to congress by the V de\npartment. President Wilson today\nsaid that \"the hope if the world is\nthat when the European war is over,\narrangements will havi been made\ncomposing many of the questions\nwhich have hitherto seemed to re\nquire the arming of the nations.\"\nThe president's statement follows:\n\"The principle embodied in the leg\nislation pressed by the War depart\nment to the military committees of\nthe senate and house have my enl). ;\napproval, and its specific recommen\ndations embody the best judgment of\nthe officers of the War department.\n\"It proposes to raise the forces nec\nessary to meet the present emergency\nhy bringing the regular army and te\nNational Guard to war strength and\nby adding the additional forces which\nwill now be needed, so that the na\ntional army will comprise three ele\nments, the regular army, the Natioi.ul\nGuard, and the so-called additional\nforces, of which at first 500,000 are\nto be authorized immediately, and\nlater increments of the same size as\nthey may be needed.\nEnlistments Will Be Uniform.\n''In order that all these forces may\ncomprise igle army, the term of\nenlistment in the! three is equalized\nand will be for the period of the\nemergency.\n\"The necessary men will be secured\nfor the regular army and the National\nGuard by volunteering, as at present,\nuntil in the judgment of the president,\na resort to a selective draft is desir\nable. The additional forces, however,\nare to be raised by selective draft\nfrom men ranging in age from 19 to 25\nyears. The quotas of the several states\nin all of these fi -:s will be in propor\ntion to their population.\n\"This legislation makes no attempt\nto solve the question of a permanent\nmilitary policy for the country, chiefly\nfor the reason that in these anxious\nand disordered times a clear view\ncannot be had either of our permanent\nmilitary necessities or of the best\nmode of organizing a proper military\nestablishment.\nPlan for This War Only.\n\"The hope of the world is that\nwhen the European war is over, ar\nrangements will have been made com\nposing many of the questions which\nhave hitherto seemed to require the\narming of the nations, ifnd that in\nsome ordered and just way the peace\nof the world may be maintained by\nsuch co-operation of force among the\ngreat nations as may be necessary to\nmaintain peace and freedom through\nout the world.\n\"When these arrangements for a\npermanent peace are made, we can de\ntermine'our military needs and adapt\nour course of military preparedness\nto the genius of a world organized for\njustice and democracy.\n\"The present bill, therefore, is\nadapted to the present situation, but\nit is drawn upon such lines as will\nenable us to continue its policy, or so\nmuch of it as may be determined to\nbe wise, when the present crisis has\noassed.\"\nThe Weather\nFor Nebraska Unnettled; probably rain.\nTemperatum at t)mahi.

The reference\nto dynastic wars, is twisted into a\nshape that has aroused indignant\ncomment from every German news\npaper. The fuli text of the message\nwas received in Copenhagen only to\nday and reads almost like another\ndocument. There is no reference made\nto the proposed financing of the allies\nand very littV: referring to Russia.\nOfficers of A. 0. U. W. Grand\nLodge Meet in Grand Island\nGrand Island, Neb., April 6.

The object of the meeting was\nto pass upon petitions filed asking for\na submission to a referendum of the\nmembers of the lodge throughout the\nstate of the rast adopted by the last\ngrand lodge held in Omaha in Jan\nuary. The grand lodge officers after mak\ning deductions for names of persons\nwho are not members, it was found\nthat the required 10 per cent of the\ntotal membership of the order had\nnot signed the petitions. In view of\nthis it was decided that no referen\ndum will be submitted.\nElmer Wiggins Dies\nIn East From Operation\nElmer Wiggins of Gothenburg,\nNeb., son of C. F.

NOW\nInterned Teuton Craft Will Be\nRegarded as Owned by This\nGovernment and Paid\nfor After War.\nIff NOT FINALLY DECIDED\nPort Officials Take Possession\nof Hundred Vessels Aggre\ngating 600,000 Tons.\nCREWS ARE INTERNED\nBulletin.\nWashington, April 6. While a final\ndecision has not been reached, indi\ncations after today's cabinet meeting\nwere that nearly a hundred German\nmerchant vessels taken over in dif\nferent ports today, will be regarded\nas the property of the American gov\nernment and paid for after the war.\nNew York, . April .6. The seizure\nof German merchant vessels that\ntook refuge in Atlantic ports at the\nbeginning of the war began this\nmorning almost immediately alter\ncongress passed the resolution de\nclaring a state of war between the\nUnited States and Germany.\nThe collector of the port at Boston\nwas the first to act. The federal\nofficials at New London, Conn., Bal\ntimore and New Yorkiquickly fol\nlowed. Before dayljpht United\nStates deputy marshals were :n\ncharge of German vessels at these\npoints, ranging in ize from the Ma\njestic Vaterland, of 54,282 gross tons,\nto small sailing vessels.\nThe port officials acted on orders\nissued by the secretary of the treas\nury. It is understood that this move\ndoes not involve confiscation and\nthat the vessels are held for the pres\nent as a measure of satety. lhere\n1iu ei I'll nu announcement as\nvj announcement as to\nwhether the government shall take\nover the ships for its use and pay for\nthem after the war.\nGerman vessels now in American\nports number ninety-one, with a gross\ntonnage of about 600,000. This in\ncludes twenty-three ships in refuge at\n! the Philippine islands, eleven at Hon\nolulu and one at Pagopago, a port ot\nthe Pacific islands. There are twenty\nseven German ships at New York an\nchored on both sides of the Hudson\nriver and off Staten island, five at\nBoston, three at Baltimore, two at\nPhiladelphia, three at San Francisco,\ntwo at New Orleans, two at South\nPort, N. C; two at Astoria, Ore.; one\neach at Portland, Ore.; Winslow,\nWash.; Seattle, Wash.; Norfolk, Va.;\nSavannah, Charleston, Jacksonville,\nFla., and Sn Juan, Porto Rico.\nLargest Ships in World.\nThe total also includes two Ger\nman vessels which have been interned.\nThe ships lying at their slips at the\nHamburg-American and North Ger\nman Lloyd docks at New York and\nHoboken include some of the flower\nof the German merchant marine. The\nVaterland, one of the largest vessels\nin the world, is by far the most valu\nable. Next in size is the George Wash\nington, 25,570 tons. Others of more\nthan 15,000 tons are the President\nGrant, President Lincoln and Kaiser\nWilhelm II. Four Austrian steam\nships also are tied up here.\nThe first vessels taken over were\nthe Hamburg, Koenig, Wilhelm II,\nPrinz Eitel Friedrich, Prinz Joachim\nand Allemannia, in the Hudson river\nat the foot of 135th street.\nThese ships total 38,128 tons, and\nthere are forty-one officers and 173\nmen in the crews.\nCrews Are Reservists.\nWashington, April 6. Seizures of\nGerman merchant ships in American\nports, according to official statement\ntoday, are measures of safety for\nthe ships themselves and adjoining\nproperty. The crews aboard are re\ngarded as German reservists.\nThe further question of what is to\nbe done with the fleet now comes up\nfor consideration. Two courses, it\nwas said, are open to the govern\nment. The ships may be impressed\ninto service and paid for at the close\nof the war or they may be confiscated\naltogether without violating Hie\nterms of the Prussian-American\ntreaty of 1828. Many officials oppose\nthe latter course unless it should be\ndecided to take it upon the principle\nof taking a ship for every American\nship destroyed illegally by a sub\nmarine. The first step now, at any rate,\nprobably will be to repair the damage\ndone toxthe machinery of the ships\nby their crews on orders of the Ger\nman government when diplomatic re\nlations were severed.\n\"Down With England at\nAny Price \" Says Haeckel\nLondon, April 6. Telegraphing\nfrnm the Hague, the Exchange Tele\ngraph's correspondent says the Ger\nman ministry of finance publishes\nthe following letter, written by Prof.\nErnst Heinrich Haeckel, professor of\nzoology in the University of Jena, as\npropaganda for the sixth German war\nloan.\n\"You have asked my opinioi. of this\ncruel world war. My answer, founded\non the words of our three greatest\nheroes, Von Hindenburg, Ludendorf\nand Von Tirpitz, is 'down with Eng\nland at any price.' \"\nBRAZIL PROBABLY\nWILL DECLARE WAR\n' ' . -\nSinking of Steamer Parana Off\nCoast of France Causes In-\ntense Indignation.\nTHREE OF CREW MISSING\nCherbourg, April 6.

It was built in 1893 and was\nowned in Rio Janeiro.\nLondon, April 6.

Persons here who have\nbeen giving attention to the subject\nthink the estimate of numbers is\nhigh, but feel no doubt that German\nsubmersible! are somewhere on this\nside of the Atlantic, most probably\nin Mexican waters, and that some of\nthem have been there Since early in\nFebruary.\nThere is no doubt here that if\nthe U boats are in the gulf they are\nbeing supplied from Mexican shore\nbases. Those who hold these views\nare convinced that something closely\napproaching the arrangements pro\nprosed by Foreign Minister Zimmer\ntnann in his celebrated communication\nintended for General Carranza, have\nbeen achieved, and that the whole\nmatter, including the supplying of\nsubmarines from Mexican shores, was\narranged by Mexican' Minister Zu-\nuaran in Berlin.\nAirplane Bombards\nTowns Along the\nCoast of Kent\nLondon, April 6.
