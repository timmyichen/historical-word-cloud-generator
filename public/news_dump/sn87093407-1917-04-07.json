Scripps, founder of the Scripps newspapers, one of which is The Seattle Star:\n<<I STRONGLY urge that we should pay as we go in the war, with income and inheritance taxes. All incomes of\n* over one hundred thousand dollars a year should be conscripted. The minimum cash pay of soldiers and\nsailors should be not less than three dollars per day during the war. Such legislation would cost me much more\nthan half my present income,\" \u2022*. /. \u2022*\u00ab\nEDITOR'S NOTE\u2014Fine, Mr. Scripps!
