Leased Wire\nLONDON, .April 6 Premier Lloyd\nGeorge today gave to the American\nnewspapers on behalf of the war cabi\nnet the following:\n\"America has at one bound become\na world power in a sense she never was\ni before. She waited until she found a\nI cause worthy of her traditions. The\nj American people held back until they\n! were fully convinced the fight was not\n! a sordid scrimmage for power and pos\n; sessions, but an unselfish struggle to\n; overthrow a sinister conspiracy against\nhuman liberty and human rights.\n'Once that conviction was reached\n1 the great republic of the west has\n: leaped into the arena and she stands\nnow side by side with the European\ndemocracies, who bruised and bleeding\nfffter three years of grim conflict, are\nstill fighting the most savage foe that\never menaced the freedom of the world,\nj \"The glowing phrases of the presi\nI dent's noble deliverance illumine the\nhorizon and make clearer than ever the\ngoal we are striving to reach.\nI \"There are three phrases which will\nj stand out forever in the story of the\ni crusade. The first is that 'the world\nj must be safe for democracy,' the next\ni 'the menace to peace and freedom lies\nI in the existence of autocratic govern\n! ment backed by organized force, which\nis controlled wholly by their will and\nnot by the will of their people,' and the\ncrowning phrase is that in which he\ndeclares that 'a steadfast concert for\npeace can never be maintained except\nby the partnership of democratic na-\ntions.\" s\nI \"These words represent the faith\nwhich inspires and sustains our people\nin the tremendous sacrifices they have\nmade and. are still making.

Leased Wire\nCOPENHAGEN (Via London) April\n6r President Wilson's appeal for a\ndemocracy in Germany seemingly has\ncreated much apprehension in conser\nvative circles in Germany, judging by\nthe energy with which the nationalist\nand reactionary newspapers are cam\npaigning against it.\nCount von Reventlow in the Tages\nZeitung -again returns to the attack\nagainst, the concept built up, as he\npreviously explained, on a false ver\nsion of President Wilson's remarks on\nearlier dynastic wars.\" He devotes a\nsecond article to the Russian features\nof the president's message, concen\ntrating on- this point, dictated by inter-\nj nal political consider\"ation, namely the\ni uteu iu eiaua against tne stormy ae\nmand for reform in those inner politi-\ncal conditions, the maintenance of\nwhich bulk larger to many Prussian\nconservatives than the winning of the\nwar.\nGermany's foes. Count von Revent\nlow writes, evidently counted that\nAmerica's, participation in the war\nwould make the deepest impression on\nGermany, not only robbing the Ger\nmans of their confidence of victory, but\nalso bringing about a predominance in\nGermany of the spirit of liberty \"which\neach of our enemies regards, and right\nly, as equivalent to the destruction oi\nGermany as a power.\"\nCount von Reventlow finds that the\nevents in Russia can be \"wonderful\nand heartening\" only in thi3 sense and\nin that of the opening of a field for\nthe investment of American capital.\nOtherwise, he says, the developments\ncan only discourage the entente, since\nthe Russian military effort can in no\ncircumstances be made stronger, and\nprobably will be much weakened there\nby and the prospect of unlimited chaos\nis open.\nsearch failed to disclose anyone.\nIt was thought by the police Ust\nnight, that the unknown man had been\nwinged, as ha waa seen to stumble one\nas if he had been hit.\nTEUTONS AGIST",
