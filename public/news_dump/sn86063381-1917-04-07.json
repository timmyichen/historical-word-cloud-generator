American flags\ncovered the walls and floated high\nabove the massed humanity which\npacked every available nook and cor\nner of the gallery and main floor.\nStrung around the hall stood the\nmembers of the militia, clad in their\nspotless white dress uniforms, under\nthe command of Lieutenant E. A.\nBarker.\nIn. one corner was stationed the\nband.playing patriotic airs, while at\nIntervals a drum corps of Civil war\nveterans \"hit 'er up\" as became the\ndays of the Civil\" war.\nFormality Absent.\nThere were no cold formalities.\nThere were no tiresome, flamboyant\nspeeches, there were smiles and\nfriendly greetings on every hand.\nBut underneatn there was that in\ndescribable \"something\" that seemed\nto draw those present closer and\nfeeling was deep-seated at the sig\nnificance of the occasion.\nAround the line of sturdy young\nUncle Sam's sea dogs, which was\nformed in a huge horseshoe, passed\nthe veterans of the Civil war in bid\nding good bye.
