In order to get such per\nmits farmers are required to go to much\nexpense in having their herds tuberculin\ntested, their barns and dairy equipment\nsanitary and in accordance 'with the\nregulations prescribed by said Health\nDepartment, And\nTimes' Stand Indorsed.\n\"Whereas members of the Mary\nland and Virginia Milk Producers'\nAssociation have all complied with\nthese regulations, believing It Jn their\nown InterAitatxJid to the best inter\nests of the consuming public, and\n\"Whereas it has been brought to\nthe attention of this association that\ncertain dealers are constantly bring\ning milk Into the District of Columbia\nfrom farms which are unlicensed, and\nwhich cannot procure licenses be\ncause of unsanitary conditions, and\nselling it to the people of Washington\nIn competition with milk from prop\nerly licensed farms, be it\n\"Resolved by the Maryland and Vir\nginia Milk Producers' Association, In\nconvention assembled, that they most\nearnestly protest against admission\nof such -milk in the District, and urge\nofficials of the government to see to\nit that all producers are made to con\nform alike to the requirements of\nthe law.\n\"And be it further resolved that\nthis association does heartily Indorse\nthe stand taken by The Washington\nTimes in publishing the facts regaru\nIng the sale of unlicensed milk In the\nDistrict, and we do hereby pledge our\nsupport to the movement to bring\nabout enforcement of the law, and to\nco-operate in every way possible with\nofficials of the Health Department In\nseeing that the city's milk supply is\nsafeguarded.\"\nAnnouncement Causes Stir.\nAnnouncement by George M. Oyster,\nJr., the biggest milk dealer In Wash\nington, that he will pay a scale of\nprices during the summer months\nslightly above that demanded by the\nproducers, created a sensation at the\nconvention and obviates all possibil\nity, officers of the association say, of\na milk strike In Washington at this\ntime.\nThe executive committee of the as\nsociation at a meeting March 30,\nvoted to ask for a continuation of the\nwinter prices throughout the summer\nmonths, and so notified all of the deal\ners. The winter prices were S3 cents\nfor milk testing 3 per cent butter\nfat and 24 cents for milk testing 4\nper cent butterfat. Oyster, in his\nstatement today announces that he\nwill pay 24 cents a gallon for 4 per\ncent milk, half a cent a gallon in ex\ncess of the producers' demands.\nOyster's statement is as follows:\n\"In making new contracts with\nthe producers of milk for their pro\nduct produced during the six months\nbeginning May I, 1917, I will make\nthe following offer for milk of satis\nfactory quality, produced under satis\nfactory conditions, and delivered f. o.\nb. cars in Washington: For 3.6 per\ncent fat, 23 cents a gallon: 3.7 per\ncent. 23i cents: 3.8 per cent, 24\ncents; 3.0 per cent, I4U cents; 4 per\ncent, 24 cents; 4.1 per cent, 241\ncents; 4.2 per cent, 25 cents: 4.3 per\ncent, 25 cents, and 4.4 milk, 22\ncents.\nTen Cents In Excess.\n\"In making new contracts with the\nproducers of cream for their product,\nproduced during the six months be\nginning May I, 1017, I will offer SI\na gallon for cream containing 20\nper cent fat, of satisfactory quality\nand produced under satisfactory con\nditions and delivered f. o. b. cars In\n\"Washington.\"\nOyster's offer for cream Is 10 cents\na gallon in excess of the price de\nmanded by the producers.\nFRENCH AND PAGE CONFER.\nLONDON.

Employment\nService and Civil Service\nCommission Planned.\nOrders were issued today looking\ntoward official welding of the United\nStates employment service and the\nCivil Service Commission into a single\nbody for the purpose of supplying the\nGovernment's hard-pressed needs for\nlabor.\nThe entire force of each body Is at\nthe disposal of the other for this pur\npbse, and instructions were sent to\nofficers in many large cities today to\nco-operate in securing labor.\nThe orders effect an interlocking\nagreement between the two services,\nwhose agents are instructed to comb\nlocalities where there are workers and\nno work, and to get such workers to\ngo to districts that are short of\nhands.\nBlanks from the civil service are to\nbe supplied to the employment serv\nice officers at once, so that they may\nact for the Civil Service Commission.\nPROVIDES MARKET\nFOR CITY TILLERS\nThe Times Arranges With\nHotels and Managers of Stalls\nTo Buy at Top Prices.\nThe Times today completed ar\nrangements for a market for all the\nvegetables raised by Washington's\ngardeners this summer.\nWashington hotel managers ex\npressed willingness to buy all veget\nables raised by amateurs this sum\nmer. They are willing to pay top\nmarket prices, and the only stipula\ntion is that the vegetables be up to\nmarket standard and be delivered at\nthe hotels.\nThis willingness of the Washington\nhotels to co-operate removes the last\nobstacle. Many jrpsjpectlve garden\nera have held back because they did\nnot know where they could sell veg\netables without going from door to\ndoor.\nNot only the hotels, but the public\nmarkets want to buy as much of the\nvegetables as Washington's garden\ners are able to raise.\nInspired By Patriotism.\nManagers of these hotels and mar\nkets are doing this patriotically, and\nnot because of a desire to save\nmoney. The vegetables they will buy\nfrom Washington's amateur garden\ners will cost them more than they\nwould pay for other such products.\nIn an endeavor to co-operate with\nthe War Department and relieve the\nrailroads of as much freight as pos\nsible, so that they may have more\ncars for transporting soldiers and\nmunitions, the hotel and market men\nare willing to forego cheaper con\ntracts with New York and Baltimore\ndealers, and pay higher prices In\nWashington.\nManagers of several hotels suggest\ned that vegetables raised under the\nsupervision of the central committee,\nof which John Dolph Is president, bo\nhandled through a central agency,\nthus eliminating waste of energy and\ntime.\n\"We will be only too glad to help in\nevery way possible,\" said the man\nagejr of the Wlllard Hotel this morn-\n(Continued on Third Page.)\nCAMP IS BURNED\nMilitary Authorities Suspect Fire at\nFort Bills Was Incendiary.\nEL, PASO, Tex., April 7.
